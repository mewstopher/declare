# Declare Model
This repository is used to create and run the Declare model.

## current state
We currently have 2 models. One is the original keras model from the source code.
There were initial problems with running the model as is, so a new attempt is made using 
Pytorch.
Glove embeddings and snopes datasets are not included but can be found at:
